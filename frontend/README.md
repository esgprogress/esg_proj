# ESGProgress Docs

This portion of the ESGProgress monorepo deals with the main public-facing website, as well as the admin panel.
It has been built using Next.js, and uses the backend at `esg_proj/backends` to serve API trial queries.

For development, just install Node.js, npm and then:

```shell
npm install
npm run dev
```

A development window will open up at http://localhost:3000, which will update alongside your code.
