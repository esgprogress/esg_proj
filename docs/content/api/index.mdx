# Overview

This section contains the official documentation for the ESGProgress API

The API can be accessed at https://www.esgprogress.org/api.

--------

### Request Handling
Every request in the Public API section can be accessed via a **GET** request. Please refer to the individual endpoint's page to learn more about the response schema.
Protected API endpoints use JWT-based Auth0 authentication. To contribute to our database, please raise a request for involvement using [this form](https://www.esgprogress.org/contribute), and we will be happy to review your request for access, and grant you an account on Auth0 if you are accepted.

--------

## Rate Limits

The official rate limit for the API (all endpoints combined) is **100** requests per 10-second rolling window, per IP address.
Swarming the system with requests from multiple IP addresses goes against the terms of service of ESGProgress.
