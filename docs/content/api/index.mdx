# Overview

This section contains the official documentation for the ESGProgress API

The API can be accessed at https://api.esgprogress.org.

--------

### Request Handling
Every request in the Public API section can be accessed via a **GET** request. Please refer to the individual endpoint's page to learn more about the response schema.
Protected API endpoints use JWT-based Auth0 authentication. To contribute to our database, please raise a request for involvement using [this form](https://www.esgprogress.org/contribute), and we will be happy to review your request for access, and grant you an account on Auth0 if you are accepted.

--------

## Rate Limits

The official rate limit for the API (all endpoints combined) is **1000** requests per 1-minute rolling window, per IP address.
This figure includes usage of our APIs that is done via interacting with our websites (www.esgprogress.org and [docs.esgprogress.org](https://docs.esgprogress.org)), command-line usage, and usage via any of your API Client(s).
Swarming the system with requests from multiple IP addresses goes against the terms of service of ESGProgress.
