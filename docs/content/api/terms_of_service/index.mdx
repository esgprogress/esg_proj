# Terms of Service

Thank you for using ESGProgress' APIs and associated software.
By accessing or using our APIs, you are agreeing to the terms below. If there is a conflict between these terms and additional terms applicable to a given API, the additional terms will control for that conflict.
Collectively, we refer to the terms below, any additional terms, terms within the accompanying API documentation, and any applicable policies and guidelines as the "Terms."
You agree to comply with the Terms and that the Terms control your relationship with us. So please read all the Terms carefully.

or (b) you are a person barred from using or receiving the APIs under the applicable laws of India or other countries including the country in which you are resident
or from which you use the APIs.

#### Entity Level Acceptance
If you are using the APIs on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have authority to bind that entity to the Terms
and by accepting the Terms, you are doing so on behalf of that entity (and all references to "you" in the Terms refer to that entity).

#### Registration
In order to access private APIs you may be required to provide certain information (such as identification or contact details) as part of the registration process for the APIs,

## Using the APIs

#### Your End Users
You will require your end users to comply with (and not knowingly enable them to violate) applicable law, regulation, and the Terms.

#### Compliance with Law, 3rd Party Rights and other Terms of Service
You will comply with all applicable law, regulation, and third party rights (including without limitation laws regarding the import or export of data or software, privacy, and local laws).
You will not use the APIs to encourage or promote illegal activity or violation of third party rights.
You will not violate any other terms of service with ESGProgress.

#### Permitted Access
You will only access (or attempt to access) an API by the means described in the documentation of that API.
If ESGProgress assigns you developer credentials (e.g. client IDs), you must use them with the applicable APIs.
You will not misrepresent or mask either your identity or your API Client's identity when using the APIs or developer accounts.

#### API Limitations
ESGProgress sets and enforces limits on your use of the APIs (e.g. limiting the number of API requests that you may make or the number of users you may serve), in our sole discretion.
You agree to, and will not attempt to circumvent, such limitations documented with each API.
If you would like to use any API beyond these limits, you must obtain ESGProgress' express consent.
ESGProgress reserves the right to deny such consent for any reason, and we reserve the right to keep the reason for denial confidential.
To seek such approval, contact us on our contribution form.

#### Open Source Software
Some of the software required by or included in our APIs may be offered under an open source license.
Open source software licenses constitute separate written agreements.
For certain APIs, open source software is listed in the documentation. To the limited extent the open source software license expressly supersedes the Terms, the open source license instead sets forth your agreement with ESGProgress for the applicable open source software.

#### Communication with ESGProgress
ESGProgress will never send you unsolicited communication over any form of communicative media.

#### Feedback
If you provide feedback or suggestions about our APIs, then we (and those we allow) may use such information without obligation to you.

#### Non-Exclusivity Agreement
The Terms are non-exclusive. You acknowledge that ESGProgress may develop products or services that may compete with the API Clients or any other products or services without advance notice to you.

## API Clients

#### Monitoring
The APIs are designed to help you enhance your websites and applications ("API Client(s)").
YOU AGREE THAT ESGPROGRESS MAY MONITOR USE OF THE APIS TO ENSURE QUALITY, IMPROVE ESGPROGRESS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND VERIFY YOUR COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS.
This monitoring may include ESGProgress accessing and using your API Client, for example to identify security issues that could affect ESGProgress or its users.
You will not interfere with this monitoring, and agree to allow ESGProgress to use reasonable technical means to overcome the aforementioned interference.
ESGProgress may suspend access to the APIs by you or your API Client without notice if we reasonably believe that you are in violation of the Terms.

#### Security
You will use commercially reasonable efforts to protect user information collected by your API Client, including personal data, from unauthorized access or use and will promptly report to your users any unauthorized access or use of such information to the extent required by applicable law.

#### Ownership
ESGProgress does not acquire ownership in your API Clients, and by using our APIs, you do not acquire ownership of any rights in our APIs or the content that is accessed through our APIs.

#### Privacy Policy
You will comply with all applicable privacy laws and regulations including those applying to personal data.
You will provide and adhere to a privacy policy for your API Client that clearly and accurately describes to users of your API Client what user information you collect and how you use and share such information (including for advertising) with ESGProgress and third parties.
