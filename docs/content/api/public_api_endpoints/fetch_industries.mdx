## Summary

Returns a list of all industries currently supported by the platform.

This endpoint is designed for **read-only access** and is commonly used by client applications to populate industry selectors such as dropdowns, filters, and search facets.

---

## Description

The **Fetch Industries** API retrieves industry records from the database and returns them as a JSON array.

Key characteristics of this endpoint:

- Publicly accessible (no authentication required)
- No query parameters or request body
- Database identifiers (`_id`) are excluded from responses
- Empty results are treated as a valid, non-error response
- Clear separation between database errors and unexpected server failures

This endpoint serves as the **authoritative source of supported industries** across the platform.

#### Headers
This endpoint **does not** accept any parameters

| Header   | Required | Description                    |
|----------|----------|--------------------------------|

----

### Response Schema

#### Success - `200 OK`

```json lines
Industry[]
```

##### Industry Object

| Field      | Type     | Description          |

```json lines

  { "industry": "Energy" },
  { "industry": "Healthcare" },
  { "industry": "Technology" }
]
```

##### Empty Response

If no industries are available, an empty array is returned:

```json lines
[]
```

------

### Error Codes & Response Types

#### ```503 Service Unavailable```
Returned when the database is temporarily unavailable, or a query fails due to a database issue

##### Response Body

``` json lines
{
    "detail" : "Database temporarily unavailable"
}
```

##### Typical Causes
1. MongoDB Connection Issues
2. Database timeout or query failure for a non-general reason

------

#### `500 Internal Server Error`

Returned when an unexpected server-side error occurs.

##### Response Body

```json lines
{
    "detail" : "Internal server error"
}
```

##### Typical Causes
1. Unhandled runtime exception
2. Application-level failure outside database operations.

-----

### Implementation Notes
1. Uses a MongoDB find() query with projection to exclude _id
2. Materializes the cursor before returning the response
3. Logs both database-specific and unexpected errors for observability
4. Treats empty datasets as a valid state, not an error condition
