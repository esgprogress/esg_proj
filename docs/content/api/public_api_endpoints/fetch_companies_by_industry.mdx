If no companies are available, an empty array is returned:

------

### Error Codes & Response Types

#### ```503 Service Unavailable```
Returned when the database is temporarily unavailable, or a query fails due to a database issue

##### Response Body

``` json lines
{
    "detail" : "Database temporarily unavailable"
}
```

##### Typical Causes
1. MongoDB Connection Issues
2. Database timeout or query failure for a non-general reason

------

#### `500 Internal Server Error`

Returned when an unexpected server-side error occurs.

##### Response Body

```json lines
{
    "detail" : "Internal server error"
}
```

##### Typical Causes
1. Unhandled runtime exception
2. Application-level failure outside database operations.

-----

### Implementation Notes
1. Uses a MongoDB find() query with projection to exclude _id
2. Materializes the cursor before returning the response
3. Logs both database-specific and unexpected errors for observability
4. Treats empty datasets as a valid state, not an error condition
