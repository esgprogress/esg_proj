# Overview

-------

This section contains information about the API endpoints that are publicly accessible.
As these are publicly accessible, no authentication is needed, but abuse will trigger rate limits.
Repeated abuse may trigger an IP block.

## Rate Limits

The official rate limit for the API (all endpoints combined) is **1000** requests per 1-minute rolling window, per IP address.
Swarming the system with requests from multiple IP addresses goes against the terms of service of ESGProgress.
