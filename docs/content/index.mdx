# Welcome to ESGProgress Docs

Clear, transparent, and standards-aligned documentation for tracking, understanding, and improving **Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)** performance.

## Getting started

These docs are designed to help you quickly understand and integrate ESGProgress APIs into your product or workflow, or understand how to contribute to them.

* 📘 **API Reference** – Endpoints for companies, industries, and ESG metrics
* 🧩 **Data Models** – Request and response schemas

If you’re new, start with the API overview. If you’re already integrating, jump directly to the relevant endpoint documentation.

## Design philosophy

ESGProgress is built around a few core principles:

* **Clarity over complexity** — simple, predictable interfaces
* **Neutral & accessible design** — readable in both light and dark modes
* **Transparency** — clear definitions, sources, and assumptions

Our goal is to make ESG data **measurable, comparable, and actionable**.
