# ESGProgress Docs

This portion of the ESGProgress monorepo deals with public-facing documentation. 
It has been built using Nextra (https://nextra.site/) on top of Next.js, and uses the existing
backend to serve API trial queries.  

For development, just install Node.js, npm and then:

```shell
npm install
npm run dev
```

A development window will open up at http://localhost:3002, which will update alongside your code.
